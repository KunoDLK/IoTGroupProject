# Project:

## Waste Management Optimization:

Problem: Static bin collection routes can leave many bins overflowing
Solution: Create a smart waste management system with fill-level so the council can optimes bin collection
Sensors: Ultrasonic distance sensors measure bin fill levels; Weight Sensor to approximate waste density; Air Monitoring for potential pollution cause by waste
