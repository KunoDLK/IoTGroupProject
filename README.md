## Waste Management Optimization:

Problem: Inefficient waste collection and overflowing bins in urban areas.
Solution: Create a smart waste management system with fill-level  and waste density monitoring for 
Sensors: Ultrasonic distance sensors measure bin fill levels; Weight Sensor to approximate waste density; Air Monitoring for potential pollution cause by waste
